# Copy this to .env and fill in your actual API keys
# The .env file is gitignored and won't be committed

# How it works:
# - Use $VARIABLE_NAME in mcp-servers.json or mcp-servers.toml files
# - The activation scripts will automatically replace $VARIABLE_NAME with values from this file
# - Example: "$CONTEXT7_API_KEY" in JSON/TOML → replaced with value below

# MCP Server API Keys
CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here

# Add other API keys as needed
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

# Any new variable added here can be used in config files as $VARIABLE_NAME
